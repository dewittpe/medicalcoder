\arguments{
\item{x}{Character vector of ICD codes (full or compact form).}

\item{icdv}{Integer vector of allowed ICD versions. Use \code{9L} and/or
\code{10L}. Defaults to both.}

\item{dx}{Integer vector indicating allowed code type(s): \code{1L} for
diagnostic (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM, CDC mortality, WHO), \code{0L} for procedural
(ICD-9-PCS, ICD-10-PCS). Defaults to both.}

\item{src}{Character vector of code sources. One or more of \code{"cms"}, \code{"who"},
\code{"cdc"}. Defaults to all.}

\item{year}{Numeric scalar. Calendar or fiscal year to reference. Default
is the most current year available per source. For ICD-9, the latest year
is 2015; ICD-10 source are updated annually.  Calendar year for WHO and CDC
mortality. Fiscal year for CMS.}

\item{headerok}{Logical scalar. If \code{FALSE} (default), only assignable
codes are considered valid; if \code{TRUE}, header codes are also accepted.}

\item{ever.assignable}{Logical scalar. If \code{TRUE} then ignore \code{year}
and return \code{TRUE} if the \code{x} was ever an assignable code.}

\item{warn.ambiguous}{Logical scalar. If \code{TRUE} (default), warn when a
code matches more than one ICD version and/or type (e.g., both CM and PCS).}

\item{full.codes}{Logical scalar. If \code{TRUE} (default), match codes that
include the decimal point where applicable.}

\item{compact.codes}{Logical scalar. If \code{TRUE} (default), match codes without
the decimal point.}
}
\value{
A logical vector the same length as \code{x}.
}
\description{
Answer the question "is the character string x a valid ICD code?"
ICD codes should be character vectors. \code{is_icd} will assess for both
"full codes" (decimal point present when appropriate) and "compact codes"
(decimal point omitted).

ICD-10 code "C00" is a header code because the four-character codes
C00.0, C00.1, C00.2, C00.3, C00.4, C00.5, C00.6, C00.7, C00.8, and C00.9
exist. Those four-character codes are assignable (as of 2025) because no
five-character descendants (e.g., C00.40) exist.

When the source is the World Health Organization (WHO) or CDC Mortality,
years refer to calendar years. CDC/CMS sources use the U.S. federal fiscal
year, which starts on October 1 (e.g., fiscal year 2024 runs 2023-10-01 to
2024-09-30).
}
\details{
Similarly for ICD-9-CM: "055" is a header for measles; 055.0, 055.1,
055.2, 055.8, and 055.9 are assignable. Codes 055.3–055.6 do not exist.
Code 055.7 is a header because 055.71 and 055.72 exist.

Some codes change status across years. For example, ICD-9-CM 516.3 was
assignable in fiscal years 2006–2011, then became a header in 2012–2015.
