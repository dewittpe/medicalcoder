All content files are compressed in ZIP format, and the files included in each ZIP file are listed below the ZIP file name.  These files have been made available in January 2009.  Subsequent to initial release, the file describing changes to the ICD-10-CM descriptions was updated (2009_I10cm_desc_chg2.pdf).  It had originally accompanied the General Equvalence Mapping (GEM) files, but it was separated to enable the update to be obtained by itself (by downloading the file 2009_I10cm_desc_chg2.zip).  The other GEM files have been made available in the file Dxgem2009b.zip.  Also, the 2009 Guidelines for ICD-10-CM have been completed and are available in the file Guidelines10cm2009.pdf, within the file Guidelines10cm2009.zip.
