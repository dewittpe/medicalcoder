#' ## Header and assignable codes
#'
#' ICD-10 code "C00" is a header code because the four-character codes
#' C00.0, C00.1, C00.2, C00.3, C00.4, C00.5, C00.6, C00.7, C00.8, and C00.9
#' exist. Those four-character codes are assignable (as of 2025) because no
#' five-character descendants (e.g., C00.40) exist.
#'
#' Similarly for ICD-9-CM: "055" is a header for measles; 055.0, 055.1,
#' 055.2, 055.8, and 055.9 are assignable. Codes 055.3–055.6 do not exist.
#' Code 055.7 is a header because 055.71 and 055.72 exist.
#'
#' Some codes change status across years. For example, ICD-9-CM 516.3 was
#' assignable in fiscal years 2006–2011, then became a header in 2012–2015.
